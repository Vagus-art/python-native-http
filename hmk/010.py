# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5),
# except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

c = set(el1 for el1 in a if b.__contains__(el1))

print(c)
